# The Movie App

“The Movies app” was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.4. It's a small and simple application that captures and stores information about movies and lists them for the users so they can later access their details. The architecture team has decided that the application must be implemented using an ​Angular SPA (​single page application). ​The Angular Version should be 7 or greater.
